Hey there! 👋 

I'm Anirudh Goel, a coding enthusiast and firmware wizard 🧙‍♂️. Currently on a quest for my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Spent a tech-packed internship at eButterfly, fluttering around React.js and PHP to enhance butterfly observations 🦋. When not electrifying cars at Waterloo Formula Electric ⚡, I'm crafting award-winning websites and building e-commerce dreams with React.js and Django 🚀. Check out my GitHub galaxy for a journey through Python, Java, TypeScript, and more! 🌌 Let's code and create some digital magic! ✨👨‍💻✨
