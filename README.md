# 👋 Hi, I’m Anirudh Goel

A software developer and coding enthusiast 💻. Currently on a quest for my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Spent a tech-packed internship at eButterfly, fluttering around React.js, HTML, CSS and React Native to enhance butterfly observations 🦋. When not electrifying cars at Waterloo Formula Electric ⚡, I'm crafting full-stack websites and building e-commerce dreams 🚀. You might also find me embarking on the mobile development frontier, turning my ideas into reality one line of code at a time! 📱✨ Check out my GitHub galaxy for a journey through Python, Java, C++, Swift, and more! 🌌 Let's code and create some digital magic! ✨👨‍💻✨
